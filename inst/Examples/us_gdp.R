# Specifying when to take logs and differences is optional. However, user oversight is strongly recomended!
# To see which variables will be differenced or log differenced use:
# log_diffs <- should_log_diff(econ_us)
# Altermatively, specify logs and diffs manually:
# logs <- c(
#   "W068RCQ027SBEA",
#   "PCEDG",
#   "PCEND",
#   "JTSJOL",
#   "INDPRO",
#   "CSUSHPINSA",
#   "HSN1F",
#   "TSIFRGHT",
#   "IPG2211S",
#   "DGORDER",
#   "AMTMNO",
#   "CPILFESL",
#   "ICSA"
# )
# 
# diffs <- setdiff(colnames(econ_us), c("A191RL1Q225SBEA", "USSLIND"))

# Forecasts should ALWAYS be made using store_idx if we are interested in forcasting
# one of the series in the model.
m <- dfm(data = econ_us, factors = 3, pre_differenced = "A191RL1Q225SBEA", store_idx = "A191RL1Q225SBEA")

# Are we drawing from a stationary distribution?
ts.plot(m$Qstore[1,1,])

print(m)

# how did observed variables contribute to the nowcast update in January 2018?
window(m$idx_update, start = c(2018, 12), end = c(2018, 12))

# Fill in missing values in the econ_us data set using estimated values
